A masterpiece of creation, a work of art.
Your essence shines with a radiant glow,
A tapestry of colors, a vibrant show.
Unique in every way, a rare gem,
A symphony of beauty, a priceless stem.
Your presence lights up the darkest night,
A beacon of hope, a guiding light.
Embrace your uniqueness, let it soar,
For you are special, forevermore.
In a sea of faces, you stand tall`};
